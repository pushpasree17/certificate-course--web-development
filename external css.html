    <p>The plea came after the All India Football Federation last week said it did not receive any bids for the commercial rights of the ISL after the Request for Proposal (RFP) on October 16, inviting bids for a 15-year contract to monetise the league's commercial and media rights.
    "Where we are right now is not a delay anymore, it's a standstill for the coaches, fans, staff members, and players. We have worked too hard, sacrificed too much to let our season vanish in silence," said star defender Sandesh Jhingan in a video posted on his social media handles.
    "The entire Indian football ecosystem are hanging in uncertainty. Dreams are paused. Future being questioned. Every day we wait, Indian football bleeds. We need action and we need it now," he asserted.
    Several national team footballers like Sunil Chhetri and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu shared a text statement expressing similar sentiments.

   "Our anger, frustration and distress has now been replaced by desperation. Desperation to play the game we love, in front of people who mean everything to us - our families, our fans," the statement read.</p></h4>
